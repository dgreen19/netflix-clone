Netflix clone project

You can see the live project [here.](https://dgreen19-netflix-clone.netlify.app/).

# Known bugs:
* Home page directs users to Login screen instead of Get Started/Sign Up like the actual Netflix site. Sign up page works as intended.

* When users navigate to their list of saved titles the page loads all titles from TMDB API instead of what the users picked. Page has to be refreshed to show the correctly selected titles. 

* Site occasionally crashes at times from navigating too quickly from page-to-page (still investigating source of issue)

# Features to be added:
* Mobile experience similar to real Netflix site.

* More responsive and flex styles for Mobile and Flex-freindly experience using site.

* Inactivity for like/dislike buttons on Card component.
